Fail the build if issue count is greater than the configured count for the selected severity. 
All the selected conditions are 'OR'ed together. 
For example: Selecting "SECURITY" and "OAS VIOLATION" will evaluate to - "Fail with more than 0 SECURITY issues with severity equal or above Low OR Fail with more than 0 OAS VIOLATION issues with severity equal or above Medium"
